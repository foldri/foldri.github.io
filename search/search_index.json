The effect of voluntary disclosure on external public financing choices,\" Job Market Paper.Draft available upon request Summary <p>This paper examines how managers\u2019 voluntary disclosure choices shape subsequent capital structure decisions between debt financing and equity financing when firms need to raise external capital in public markets. I posit that managers of good-type firms (firms with higher future profitability) have two signaling options: (1) debt financing or (2) disclosure and equity financing. Because disclosure resolves information asymmetry, it makes equity issuance cheaper. Therefore, disclosure complements equity and substitutes for bonds. The optimal choice depends on the relative costs of the two options.                  Using data on U.S. public firms from 2003 to 2024, I show that good-type firms exhibit a positive relation between disclosure and equity issuance and a negative relation between disclosure and bond issuance. Cross-sectional tests based on disclosure costs and default risk, as well as two regulatory shocks\u2014the 2005 Securities Offering Reform and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2014support the prediction that firms substitute between bond financing and the disclosure-equity bundle. These findings reconcile empirical inconsistencies in the pecking-order theory by showing that good-type firms prefer equity when it is bundled with voluntary disclosure.</p> <p>Presented at: Wharton Accounting Workshop (2025), Doctoral Seminar in Accounting Research Zurich (2024)</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>\"I need a network: determinants and real effects of bond roadshows,\" with Mingxuan Ma and Sike Chen.SSRN link Summary <p>Equity roadshows are a well-studied phenomenon, and the literature has found that their primary purpose is to reduce information asymmetry and underpricing. However, little is known about the determinants and real effects of bond roadshows.                 This paper examines why firms decide to conduct a roadshow when issuing bonds and their real effects on the cost of bonds - a literature gap possibly due to a lack of readily available data, which we had to manually collect.                 We conduct surveys with underwriters and issuers to gain their insights on the role of bond roadshows and obtain two conflicting answers: according to underwriters, bond roadshows have an informational role, while according to issuers, they have a marketing role. We test these opposing views in the German bond market (2014\u20132023), finding evidence in support of the marketing role. We show that bond roadshows aim to raise investors' attention and increase their demand in the primary market, possibly to establish a network of institutional investors.                 The different role that bond roadshows have compared to equity roadshows underscores the importance of closing the literature gap and studying their real effects. We test and find that bond roadshows reduce the cost of bonds for firms, reducing bonds' final spread and substituting for the need for underpricing to ensure successful issuance.                 These findings offer novel insights into the role of the investors' networks in bond markets, highlighting how roadshows influence capital-raising outcomes.</p> <p>Presented at: poster session of the Rising Scholar Conference in Finance (2025), Doctoral Seminar in Accounting Research Zurich (2025)*</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>\"Mandatory Sustainability Reporting and Project Selection,\" with Hui Chen.SSRN link Summary <p>We examine the implications of a regulatory shift in sustainability reporting from voluntary to mandated regime in a market with responsible investors. A myopic manager must choose between a brown project and a green project, both of which generate an uncertain financial return and an environmental externality. Since the information quality on externality is not perfect, the manager always under-invests in the green project in both reporting regimes, but more severely so in the voluntary regime due to the optional value voluntary disclosure provides in concealing bad information. Adopting mandatory disclosure thus improves firms' sustainability performance and investor welfare. However, considering the costs associated with mandatory disclosure, it is more efficient only when the quality of a firm's sustainability information is sufficiently high. To ensure an efficient shift to sustainability disclosure mandates, firms should first improve the quality of their sustainability information systems.</p> <p>Presented at: Raising Scholars Conference on Sustainability Finance Zurich (2024), 15th Workshop on Accounting and Economics WU Vienna (2024), Doctoral Seminar in Analytical Accounting Research Zurich (2023), 1st Interdisciplinary Workshop on Sustainability and ESG Dynamics LIUC Universit\u00e0 Cattaneo Milano (2023).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"research/#work-in-progress","title":"Work in Progress","text":"<ul> <li>\"Environmental feedback effect,\" with Daniela Zipperer.</li> <li>\"When horizons converge: investor selection, firm output and aggregate welfare,\" with Igli Bajo.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":"University of Zurich Continuing Education <ul> <li>Teaching Skills Program Diploma - Systematic development of university-level teaching skills in instructors.
