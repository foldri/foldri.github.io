                <p>This paper examines how voluntary disclosure influences capital structure choices for firms
                    raising external capital under information asymmetry. I develop a model in which managers
                    of good-type firms choose whether to disclose the future profitability of a prospective project
                    and whether to issue debt or equity to finance it. Managers of good-type firms have two
                    options to reduce the problem of information asymmetry when raising external capital: (1)
                    issue debt or (2) disclose and issue equity. The optimal choice depends on the relative costs
                    of disclosure and debt. Using data from U.S. public firms from 2002 to 2023, I show that, for
                    good-type firms, voluntary disclosure is positively associated with equity issuance and negatively associated with bond issuance. Cross-sectional analyses based on disclosure costs and default risk, as well as two regulatory settings—the 2005 Securities Offering Reform and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—support the prediction that firms raising external capital substitute between debt and equity issuance accompanied by disclosure. These findings help reconcile empirical inconsistencies in the pecking order theory. In particular, augmenting the pecking order theory with disclosure explains why some good-type firms prefer issuing equity.</p>

                <p>This paper examines why firms conduct roadshows prior to bond issuance and investigates
                their ex-post impact on the cost of bond financing and bond underpricing. Using data from
                the German bond market (2014–2023), we find that roadshows primarily serve as a marketing
                tool—boosting investor interest and increasing demand—rather than as a feedback mechanism.
                Firms that conduct bond roadshows experience larger upward price revisions, higher oversubscription
                ratios in the primary market, and lower financing costs. We also test the empirical
                prediction of the book-building theory (Benveniste and Spindt (1989)), namely that securities
                underpricing is positively associated with investor interest. We confirm this relationship in the
                German bond market but find no evidence that roadshows directly affect bond underpricing.
                These findings offer novel insights into the role of investor relations in debt markets, highlighting how roadshows influence capital-raising outcomes.</p>

                <p>We examine the implications of a regulatory shift in sustainability reporting from voluntary to mandated regime in a market with responsible investors. A myopic manager must choose between a brown project and a green project, both of which generate an uncertain financial return and an environmental externality. Since the information quality on externality is not perfect, the manager always under-invests in the green project in both reporting regimes, but more severely so in the voluntary regime due to the optional value voluntary disclosure provides in concealing bad information. Adopting mandatory disclosure thus improves firms' sustainability performance and investor welfare. However, considering the costs associated with mandatory disclosure, it is more efficient only when the quality of a firm's sustainability information is sufficiently high. To ensure an efficient shift to sustainability disclosure mandates, firms should first improve the quality of their sustainability information systems.</p>
