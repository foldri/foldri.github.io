# **Numpy Basics**
To get started, install `numpy` using `pip` or `conda` package managers, or make sure that you have a recent version of numpy in your active Python environment.


```python
# as usual, import the module
import numpy as np # np is the standard name of numpy
```

## 1. **Arrays**
The fundamental object in numpy are numpy arrays, `np.array`s. They are iterable objects which behave much like lists. They can have many dimensions. Create an array as follows. 


```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # create a numpy array from a list
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # create a 2-d array from a list with two lists
print("a = ", a, '\n', "A = ", A, sep="") # extra bit of python: sep argument in print function defines the separating string
```

You cannot create numpy arrays from *any* kind of list. If your list contains integers and floats, integers will be 'up-cast' to the float datatype. If your list contains string, all else will be up-cast to string. What if it contains another datatype, like a list? Brace for an error.


```python
print("an up-cast array to float: ", np.array([1.2, 1, 3]))
print("an up-cast array to str: ", np.array(['1.2', 1, 3]))

#print("something illegal: ", np.array([1, 2, 3, [1, 2]]) ) # this will throw an error
```

**Exercise:** Use the 'dtype' argument to save the list `[1.9, 1, 3]` as a numpy array consisting of str/float/int/bool. What do you notice in the `int`-case? In the `bool`-case?


```python
print("Begin with list: ", [1.9, 1, 3])
print("forced data-type to str: ", np.array([1.9, 1, 3], dtype=int))
print("forced data-type to int: ", np.array([1.9, 1, 3], dtype=str))
print("forced data-type to int: ", np.array([1.9, 1, 3], dtype=bool))
```

**Exercise:** Explore the commands `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.full` as follows:

- instantiate a `(2, 3, 4)` array with each of the commands
- select element `[0, 0, 2]` for each object and set its value to `100`
- print each object.



```python
A = np.zeros(shape=(2, 3, 4))
B = np.ones(shape=(2, 3, 4))
C = np.full((2, 3, 4), 4) # different syntax for full

for x in [A, B, C]:
    x[0,0,2] = 100

# extra bit of python syntax:
# "abc" * 10 produces a string which repeats "abc" 10 times.
print(A, "\n ", "-" * 70,  "\n",  B, "\n ", "-" * 70,  "\n", C) 
```

Arrays have *methods* and *attributes* associated with them. An attribute is `dtype`, another attribute is `shape`. We will cover *methods* below.


```python
print(A.dtype, "\n", A.shape, sep="")
```

The command `np.empty` instantiates an empty array, the command `np.empty_like` instantiates *some* array which has the same dimension and data type as a given array. Empty arrays are computationally less wasteful to produce than e.g. `np.zeros`, if one replaces the elements in some process anyways. The print function called on an empty array produces mostly garbage, don't worry about this.

The following two are equivalent: `np.empty(shape = A.shape)` and `np.empty_like(A)`


```python
print(np.empty(shape = A.shape).dtype)
print(np.empty_like(A).shape)
print(np.empty((2, 3)))
```

### Array Indexing
Indexing arrays is easy and best done by example. We can select elements by regular indexing and Boolean indexing:


```python
A = np.matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # a matrix is basically a (n,m)-array
print(A)

# indexing
A[1,0] = A[1,0]*10 # multiply element [0,1] by 10
print(A)

# boolean mask
A[A < 3.2] = 0 # replace all elements < 3.2 by 0
print(A)
```

Note that above we created a `np.matrix`, which is in many ways similar to a numpy array. However, it has some methods associated with it which are specific for linear algebra. Additionally, some operators are interpreted differently. The asterisk `*` defines element-wise multiplication for arrays, but always refers to matrix-multiplication for matrices. Furthermore, when making a boolean comparison where only matrices are involved, the returned object will be a _boolean matrix_ and also have matrix operations associated to it.

Note that the Boolean comparison is done element-wise on the elements of the matrix (here, `A`):


```python
A > 10
```

Finally, we consider the difference between *views* and *copies*:

If we want to obtain a true copy of some array `A`, we need to enclose it in `np.copy`. Otherwise, we will obtain a view, which if called links back to the original object `A`.


```python
A_copy = np.copy(A) # use the copy function to make A_copy, which DOES NOT change if we change A

# however, this LHS variable will 'point' to the elements of A_copy
# if we change stuff in A_copy[0,:], then the_first_row_of_A_copy changes
the_first_row_of_A_copy = A_copy[0,:] 
print(the_first_row_of_A_copy)

A_copy[0,:] = np.arange(1, 4, 1) # np.arange(start, end, step) creates a sequence from start to (excluding) end, in 'step'-size
print(the_first_row_of_A_copy)

```

We can slice arrays in any dimensions using the usual `i:j:k` syntax: select every `k`th element from `i` to `j`.

**Exercise:** 
- Write a function `make_shift_mat` which takes a number $n$ and outputs the $n$ by $n$ *shift matrix* 
  
$$
\begin{align*}
S_n =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

- Create another function `make_nilpotent_mat` which takes as argument a list of integers `[n_1, n_2, ..., n_m]` and outputs the a matrix which has $S_{n_1}, ..., S_{n_m}$ on the diagonal and is $0$ in all other entries.
- Then create a function `get_np_index` which takes in a nilpotent matrix $N$ and calculates the (least) $k$, for which $N^k = \mathbf{0}$ (the zero matrix)

*HINT: To calculate a matrix product of two arrays `A, B` of conforming dimension, use `A@B`.*

**Solution:**


```python
# a solution with a loop
def make_shift_mat(n):
    A = np.zeros([n,n])
    for i in range(n-1):
        A[i,i+1] = 1
    return A

# an alternative way with slicing
def make_shift_mat(n):
    A = np.zeros((n,n))
    A[np.arange(n-1), np.arange(1,n)] = 1
    
    return A

make_shift_mat(8)

def make_nilpotent_mat(dim_list): 
    B = np.zeros((sum(dim_list),sum(dim_list)))
    start = 0
    for n in dim_list:
        end = start + n
        B[start:end, start:end] = make_shift_mat(n)
        start += n
    return B


def get_np_index(M, max_iter=10_000):
    M_copy = M.copy()
    counter = 0
    while not np.all(M_copy == 0):
        counter += 1
        M_copy = M_copy @ M

        if counter >= max_iter:
            print("NO NILPINDEX FOUND")
            return None      

    print("NILPINDEX", counter+2)
    return counter+2


def get_np_index(M, max_iter=10_000):
    M_copy = M.copy()
    
    for i in range(max_iter):
        
        M_copy = M_copy @ M

        if np.all(M_copy == 0):    
            print("NILPINDEX", i+2)
            return i+2

    print("NO NILPINDEX FOUND")
    return None      


M = make_nilpotent_mat([6, 2, 5])

get_np_index(M)
# check that it works
M @ M @ M @ M @ M @ M 
```

### Functions to Make Arrays 
Numpy has a few handy built-in methods to create arrays of different kinds. `np.ones` and `np.zeros` are such. Now we look at two more: `np.linspace` and `np.logspace`. 


```python
np.linspace(start=0., stop=100, num=20) # create a grid from 0 to 100 with 20 grid points
np.logspace(start=np.log(1), stop=np.log(100), num=20, base = np.e) # create a grid from 0 to 100 with 20 grid points but in logs

# the latter is equivalent to 
lower = np.log(1) # np.log( . ) is the natural logarithm
upper = np.log(100)
np.exp(np.linspace(lower, upper, 20)) # use broadcasting here, see next section

```

The function `np.arange` is very similar to the native `range()` function:


```python
np.arange(start=1, stop=20, step=3)
```

## 2. **Computations and Broadcasting**
One can do pretty much all basic computations on `np.array`s and these will be applied elementwise. (These computations are also called *vectorized* functions.) 

Let's also consider some functions coming with numpy: `np.exp, np.log, np.abs`.


```python
a = np.arange(1,10,2)
print(a)

# multiplication / addition with a scalar
print(a * 10)
print(a + 10)

# exponential function, log function
print(np.exp(a))
print(np.log(a))

b = np.array([-1,0,1])
print(np.abs(b))
```

We can add two `np.array`s together element-wise in the obvious fashion. This is called 'broadcasting'. My advice: While useful, try to avoid situations in which non-obvious broadcasting things can happen.

Instead of addition, we can perform above computations with multiplication `*` or exponentiation `**`, too.

An interesting way to leverage broadcasting is to use `np.newaxis`, which creates an additional yet empty dimension to an array. For example, let `a = np.array([1, 2, 3])`. Then `a[:, np.newaxis]` has shape `(3, 1)` and `a[np.newaxis, :]` has shape `(1, 3)`. What does the following broadcasting procedure yield: `B = a[np.newaxis, :] + a[:, np.newaxis] `?

Think it through. If you repeat `a[np.newaxis, :]` on the second axis you get a `(3,3)` array. Same if you repeat `a[:, np.newaxis]` thrice on the first axis. Then, you add the two resulting matrices elementwise. That's basically an outer product!


```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

print(a**2, "\n")

print(a[:, np.newaxis].shape, "\n")

print(a[np.newaxis, :] + a[:, np.newaxis], "\n")

print(a[np.newaxis, :] ** a[:, np.newaxis])
```

**Rules of Broadcasting**

Now we have seen Broadcasting in action, let's consider the rules that NumPy us using to determine how it operates on two arrays:

* *Rule 1*: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.
* *Rule 2*: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.
* *Rule 3*: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.

Consider an operation on `matrix` and `array`. The shape of each is:

- ``matrix.shape = (2, 3)``
- ``array.shape = (3,)``

Rule 1 tells us that ``array`` has fewer dimensions, so we pad it on the left with ones:

- ``matrix.shape -> (2, 3)``
- ``array.shape -> (1, 3)``

Rule 2, tells us the first dimension disagrees, so we stretch itnsion to match:

- ``matrix.shape -> (2, 3)``
- ``array.shape -> (2, 3)``

Now the shapes match, and we see the output of a ufunc operation will be ``(2, 3)``:

*(Source PP4RS, 2023)*

Above, we have seen *rule 2* in action. Now look at *rule 1*:


```python
# Example of padding

a = np.matrix([2, 2, 2])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

print(a.shape, b.shape) # look at the shape of array and matrix

(a + 0 * b).shape # look at the shape of the broadcasted result
```

### Array Methods
We spent a minute on useful methods (=functions) associated with `numpy` objects. First, we create an array. Then we `reshape`the array. Then we consider some `sum`, `max`, `min`, `mean` commands.


```python
a = np.arange(1, 100, 3.1234) 

print(a.shape) # well, lets make this a (4, 8) array. 
# the reshape method will first fill up the columns, for row 1, then for row 2, etc until all rows are filled
# an analogous reshaping occurs when looping through multiple dimensions.

a = np.reshape(a, (4, 8))
print(a.shape)

# global max
print(a.max())

# row max: take max over the first dimension
print(a.max(axis=0))

# column min: take min over the second dimension
print(a.min(axis=1))

# the mean and sum methods work completely analogously.
```

Note: instead of using `np.copy(a)`, we can always write `a.copy()` since `copy()` is a method of the numpy object.

### Matrix Computations
Of course we can use matrix algebra with `numpy`.


```python
# transpose of A
A.transpose()

# multiply A to A'
A @ A.transpose()

np.dot(A, A.transpose()) # alternatively, use np.dot instead of @

```

## 3. **The `np.random` Module**

The `np.random` module is a collection of functions able to generate random variables and fill array with those. For instance, `np.random.uniform` generates samples drawn from the uniform distribution. Can you guess what `np.random.randint` will give us?


```python
u = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=1, size=100)

# random matrix
u = u.reshape(10,10)

# random matrix with integers
u_int = np.random.randint(low=0, high=101, size=100).reshape(10,10)
```

**Exercise:**

Write the function `demean` which takes two inputs, a numpy array `A` and `axis` defaulting to `None`. If `axis` is equal to the default, the function calculate the mean across all elements of `A` and subtract this mean from each element. If `axis = i`, then the function calculates the means of `A` along that axis and only demeans in this direction. For example, it calculates $a_{i, j, k, l} - \bar a_{i, j, \cdot, l}$ if `axis = 2`. (This means the third dimension is used to calculate means.)


```python
def demean(A, axis=None):
    A_mean = A.mean(axis=axis, keepdims = True)
    return A - A_mean # broadcasting rule 2 is our friend here

demean(A, axis=1) 
```

## 4. **Other Exercises**

**Exercise: Discretizing the asset space**

Consider the situation in which we want to create an asset grid for the households in your favorite macro-model. Households choose assets from $[\underline a, \infty)$, need to discretize this grid. Idea: there should be more grid points around $\underline a$, because policy function is more nonlinear here. But we also want some points for high $a$. Solution: *double exponential transformation of uniformly spaced grid*:

$$a_i = \underline a + e^{e^{u_i} - 1} - 1, u_i \in [0, \bar u]$$

Write a function `discretize_assets(amin, amax, n_a)` which outputs an asset grid ranging from `a_min` to `a_max` with `n_a` grid points, where $a_i$ is determined by the formula above.


```python
# SOLUTION:

# write a function which discretizes the asset space
def discretize_assets(amin, amax, n_a):
    # find ubar 
    ubar = np.log(np.log(amax - amin + 1)+1)
    # make linar grid for the u's
    grid_u = np.linspace(0,ubar, n_a)
    # transform back to a
    grid_a = amin + np.exp(np.exp(grid_u)-1)-1
    return grid_a

grid_a = discretize_assets(0, 10_000, 50)

# visualize the grid
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# some useful plot defaults
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size' : 10, 'lines.linewidth' : 1.5, 'figure.figsize' : (4,3)})
# scatter plot of the grid
plt.scatter(grid_a, np.repeat(1, len(grid_a)), marker='|')
```
