This course is targeted at PhD students and practitioners, who would like to improve their coding skills in macroeconomics. The notebooks teach core scientific computing libraries (`numpy`, `numba`, `scipy`) and functional and object-oriented programming style by example. Examples are economic applications. As the course progresses, notebooks become increasingly focused on applying the coding concepts to state-of-the-art methods in computational econoimcs.
